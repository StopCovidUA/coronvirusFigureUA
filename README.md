Hi.
Welcome to the copy of https://covid19uk.live/ codebase. See original readme for details https://github.com/StopCovidUA/coronvirusFigureUA/blob/master/readme_uk.md

In order to notify in an analytics way would be nice to have this project adopted for Ukraine.
The only resource for the project is Telegram channel of Ministry of Healthcare of Ukraine https://t.me/COVID19_Ukraine

MVP should be
- create stats.json maintainable in this repo as a copy of https://coronauk.isjeff.com/
- reconfigure code to be using json from github
- deploy a site
